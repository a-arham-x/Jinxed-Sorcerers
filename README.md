### Theme of the Game
*Jinxed Sorcerers is a two-player survival game based on teamwork and collaboration.*

### Setting of the Game
*It is the 1400 century; a strange curse has unleashed a horde of demons and undead in the world. Everything is in a state of eternal chaos. Only a few people have the power to defeat this threat and return the world to peaceful times. We play as two mages who possess an ancient power spell that creates a powerful blast capable of purging ghosts and undead alike. However, the spell is incomplete; the blast requires close proximity, and it can only occur in the direction of the other mage. The mages must coordinate their movements and blasts to purge their enemies and free the world from the powerful curse.*
